# Q&A (Developer Knowledge Base)

This folder contains a curated **question-and-answer style** knowledge base for the `garageinn` repository. The goal is to document *how the project works in practice* (setup, architecture, key flows, and operational concerns) in a way that is fast to scan and easy to keep up to date.

## Who this is for

- New developers onboarding to the project
- Contributors who need a quick refresher on a subsystem (auth, database, APIs, etc.)
- QA/Support/Operations who need “how does it work” references tied to the codebase

## How to use this section

- Start with **Getting started** if you’re setting up the repo for the first time.
- Use the **Architecture** and **Features** sections to understand major building blocks and domain flows.
- Use **Operations** for runtime behavior (errors, observability, etc.).
- Each page is written as **Q&A**: jump directly to the question you have.

## Index

### Getting started
- [How do I set up and run this project?](./getting-started.md)

### Architecture
- [How is the codebase organized?](./project-structure.md)

### Features
- [How does authentication work?](./authentication.md)
- [How is data stored and accessed?](./database.md)
- [What API endpoints are available?](./api-endpoints.md)

### Operations
- [How are errors handled?](./error-handling.md)

## How these docs relate to the codebase

This repository is a monorepo with multiple apps and shared utilities. When you read Q&A pages, expect references to (non-exhaustive):

- **Web app**: `apps/web` (Next.js-style structure with `src/app/...`)
- **Mobile app**: `apps/mobile`
- **Backend / Supabase functions**: `supabase/functions`
- **E2E tests (usage examples)**: `apps/web/e2e`

When adding or updating a Q&A page, prefer linking to concrete code locations (files/folders) and, when relevant, point to an E2E spec that demonstrates the behavior end-to-end.

## Contributing / updating Q&A pages

### When to add a new page
Create a new Q&A document when:
- A topic would otherwise become a long section inside an existing page
- The topic is referenced repeatedly (e.g., “impersonation”, “RBAC”, “checklists execution flow”)
- There’s a repeated onboarding question that isn’t already covered

### Suggested format for new pages
- A short intro describing the scope
- A table of contents for the questions on that page (optional)
- Questions as headings (`## Question...`)
- Answers that include:
  - Key concepts and constraints
  - Links to relevant code
  - Examples (CLI commands, minimal code snippets, or pointers to E2E tests)

### Keep pages practical
Prefer:
- “Do this” steps
- Known gotchas
- Where to look in the code

Avoid:
- Overly theoretical explanations
- Repeating what the framework docs already cover, unless it’s customized here

## Generated index note

The index above may be maintained manually or generated by tooling. If you add/remove a Q&A page, ensure it’s linked from this `README.md` so it remains discoverable.
